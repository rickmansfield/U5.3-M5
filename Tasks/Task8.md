As I have only been doing these for a few days I find drawing the concepts a 'must'. It's so hard to visualize what's going on. I think I overcomplicated my first solution. But, I have been researching collections and builtins and used "deque" for my stack and was feeling cool about it. Then later I realized it wasn't even necessary and rewrote a second solution that accomplished the same thing without the builtins because Michael said we should be able to do it without them first. My initial solution involved a LIFO stack and DFT approach. It's a bit clunky now that I look at it. The alternative solution is a lightbulb going off and realize that it's just a substitution. The second solution doesn't use a while loop and is more efficient. But I put more brain power into my less efficient solution. Sheepish hand in the monkey jar.
