The solution I chose to submit is NOT the most efficient. The alternative is. The solution I submitted uses a while loop and this DFT/Stack/LIFO approach which ends up giving me for the stack only time O(1) for any push, pop, peek and space only O(n). The binary search tree was negligible too. again if balanced that would be O(log_n) and worst if unbalanced O(n) That part is fast. But my while loop added an O(n) as the size of the tree is completely traversed and not just stopped at any particular node. Space remained O(n) as each item in the stack will take up space in memory. This too is negligible for these smaller tests. But in real life, it could have been something enormous.
