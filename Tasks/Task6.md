The summation approach through this binary search tree BST has a O(n) space complexity since the depth of the tree determines the space needed to hold the sum. If the tree is balanced it could have theoretically been O(log_n) but more often then not I'd guess the trees will be unbalanced unless planned out to be balanced. Sine I wasn't adding or deleting and only counting the time complexity is similar O(n) dependent upon tree size. One of the main strengths of a BST is that it is sorted by default. You can pull out the data in order by using an in-order traversal. BSTs also have efficient searches (O(log n)).

In my solution Time is O(n) and space is O(n) as far as I can tell and that is only improved if the tree is balanced which then it could be (O(log n) for lookup. Sure there are likely DRY-er ways to write this block but not many if any would be noticeably faster.
