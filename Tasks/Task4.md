## Instructions 
- You are given the root node of a binary serach tree (BST)
- You need to write a function that returns the sum of the values of all the nodes with a value between lower and upper(inclusive)
- The BST is guaranteed to have unique values

Example 1: 
```
input: 
root = [11, 6, 16, 4, 8, null, 19]
lower 8 
upper 16

     11
     /\
    6  16
   /\   \
  4  8   19
```
output = 35
